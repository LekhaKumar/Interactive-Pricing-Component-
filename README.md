## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

What types of challenges I confront and how was I able to solve them:

- Difficulty on creating slider range and toggle switch. I used Bootstrap 5 component and sources from w3school to create these two switches.
- Difficulty on connecting the two switches using Javascript. I wrote one callback function for the toggle switch and a function for the slider range and called the function after running the first callback function. 
- Implemented Bootstrap 5 for the card component for neater look.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5.0

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned on how to create an interactive pricing component by applying switches and sliders. Through this project, I can create a pricing component which can save space and avoid decluttering where the customer can check the prices by just slide the ranges. This project is a great milestone for me as I learned Javascript in more depth. 



### Continued development

This project is a great tool where the switches and slider ranges can be applied for other types of projects to increase the interactivity of the websites.
